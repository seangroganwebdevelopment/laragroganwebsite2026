        <h1>Songwriter, composer, and storyteller.</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Lara Grogan grew up with a deep love for songwriting and narrative music — shaped early by artists such as Joni Mitchell,
          The Beatles, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and Carole King.

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, Lara has drawn inspiration from many musicians while developing her own distinctive sound — blending pop, folk,
          rock, and classical influences, guided by curiosity and creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2024, she released her debut album <em>The Sculptor</em>, a collection of songs written between the ages of 14 and 18.
          For the album, she also composed and arranged the string quartet parts. The title track, <em>The Sculptor</em>, was a
          Semi-Finalist in the Singer-Songwriter category of the UK Songwriting Contest 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022, she composed and performed <em>City and Its People</em>, a piece created for the opening of Esch 2022, European Capital of Culture.
        </p>

        <h2>Current work</h2>
        <p>
          Lara is currently working on a live music project close to her heart: <em>Tales &amp; Legends in Song</em>.
          Inspired by little-known legends and tales of Luxembourg’s medieval past, the project brings these stories to life in a contemporary way,
          exploring themes such as communication, self-confidence, courage in the face of change, and the complexities of human nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Education &amp; languages</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Luxembourg in 2004, Lara Grogan is fluent in five languages, with English as her mother tongue.
          She is currently studying at the Hochschule für Musik und Tanz in Cologne, Germany.
